        <p class="jobtitle"><strong>2022 - Present: Accommodation Systems Officer<span>Lancaster University, Lancaster</span></strong></p>
            <p>Current Role - Needs updating</p>

            <p class="jobtitle"><strong>2019 - 2022: Epos & Stock Controller<span>Lancaster University, Lancaster</span></strong></p>
            It is in my remit to resolve any EPoS/network issues and I currently use MCR systems to do this.  In this role, I am also responsible for a number of auditing, administrative and accounting duties surrounding the running of the 15 University-managed catering/retail venues. Alongside this, I have competing deadlines whilst also working on both short and long term projects. These can be from preparing EPoS screens for functions and events held at the University to compiling information for month and year-end financial reporting. I audit, report and account for wages, stock levels, purchases, expenses and transfers for the venues using Excel and bespoke software from MCR and Unit 4 (agresso).
            Some notable achievements during my time in the role:
        <ul>
            <li>Project Manager for the overhaul of the entire EPoS  system at the University as the old system was becoming outdated.</li>
            <li>Lead the negotiations for a tender of EPoS Software with a number of external EPoS suppliers.</li>
            <li>Recently negotiated a £10,000 discount (with a possible future discount) with our EPOS provider.</li>
            <li>To take the lead on the EPOS system tender once finalised and implement the project.</li>
            <li>Taken on the role of PCI DSS practitioner for the retail department.</li>
            <li>Create detailed, bespoke and ad-hoc reports for the retail and hospitality departments.</li></p>
        </ul>
            <p class="jobtitle"><strong>2018 - 2019: Production Leader (Manager)<span>Elis (Berendsen), Kendal</span></strong></p>
            During my time at Elis I was part of a newly strengthened team that brought a failing plant to break even. Here I was responsible for the smooth running of a large laundry plant employing around 200 people. Depending on which shift I covered I was responsible for the leadership, training and safe and efficient working of around 70 staff members. I undertook regular projects across the departments to find efficiencies in the laundry process to save time and money.</p>
            
            <p class="jobtitle"><strong>2008 - 2018: Operations Supervisor<span>Seatruck Ferries, Heysham</span></strong></p>
            During my 10 years at Seatruck, whilst working through the financial crisis of 2008, I was part of a small team that grew Seatruck’s Irish Sea service to twice its size and it became the fastest growing freight operator on the Irish Sea for a number of years.</p>
            I began this role as an Operations Assistant in 2008 and was promoted to Relief Supervisor in 2010 before being promoted to Operations Supervisor shortly after. I have gained invaluable knowledge and experience in being able to manage a small to medium size team of around fifteen to twenty people in a busy office with up to 500 visitors a day. My daily duties were to:
        <ul>    
            <li>Manage the daily turnaround of a ro-ro ferry.</li>
            <li>Construct and compile official documents such as hazardous manifests, cargo loading plans and cargo manifests.</li>
            <li>Liaise with various stakeholders both internally and externally in a variety of circumstances ranging from Captain to Stevedore.</li>
            <li>React and respond quickly to find solutions to matters arising with the turnaround and to prioritise efficiently.</li>
            <li>Respond to customer enquiries concerning their shipments professionally and efficiently. Building close working relationships with the customers in the process and delivering excellent customer service.</li>
            <li>Find operational solutions to commercial requirements</p>
        </ul>   
            <p class="jobtitle"><strong>2005 - 2008: Student<span>University of Cumbria/NHS, Lancaster</span></strong></p>
            In 2005 I enrolled at the University of Cumbria where I began studying nursing. During this time I achieved 120 credits in a DipHE Nursing course which equates to a Certificate of Higher Education in Nursing. From this time I have acquired a lot of qualities, not least my interpersonal and communicative skills. I have learned how to actively listen, am naturally sympathetic and considerate.</p>
